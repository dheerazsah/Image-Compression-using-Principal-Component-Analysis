# Image Compression using Principal Component Analysis

Image compression is a technique used to reduce the size of an image file while preserving its quality as much as possible. One popular method for image compression is Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

PCA is a mathematical technique used to reduce the dimensions of a dataset while retaining as much information as possible. In image compression, PCA is applied to the image data to extract the most important features and represent them using a smaller set of values.

The basic idea behind PCA for image compression is to convert the image data into a set of coefficients that represent the image's principal components. These coefficients are obtained by projecting the original image data onto a set of orthogonal vectors that capture the most significant variations in the image.

To apply PCA for image compression, the following steps are typically taken:

1. Convert the image data into a matrix of pixel values.
2. Subtract the mean pixel value from each pixel to center the data around zero.
3. Compute the covariance matrix of the image data.
4. Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.
5. Sort the eigenvectors in order of their corresponding eigenvalues, with the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue being the first.
6.Select a subset of the eigenvectors that capture the most significant variations in the image.
7. Project the image data onto the selected eigenvectors to obtain a set of coefficients that represent the image's principal components.
8. Encode the coefficients using an appropriate compression algorithm.

To reconstruct the compressed image, the following steps are typically taken:

1. Decode the compressed coefficients.
2. Multiply the coefficients with the corresponding eigenvectors to obtain the original pixel values.
3. Add the mean pixel value back to each pixel to center the data around its original range.
4. PCA can be used to achieve significant compression ratios while retaining good image quality, especially for images with large areas of homogeneous color or texture. 

However, PCA compression is not suitable for images with high frequency details or sharp edges, as these features may be lost during compression.
